Echo server
===========

You have created an echo server with [Socket: echo server](../echo-server/README.md), 
now you need to create a client.

An echo client should be an interactive script, means read 
inputs from a console (or whatever you want), send it to
the server, prints the response from the server, then back
to reading input state.

Example input:
```
> hello
hello
> world
world
>
```
